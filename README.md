Assessing Community Accessibility to Parks for Sustainable Development in Calgary

Samuel Champagne-Guenette/University of Calgary/samuel.champagneguen@ucalgary.ca

The data was all collected on October 4th and covers the metropolitan area of Calgary.

This project evaluates park accessibility across Calgary's communities to understand disparities in access and propose recommendations for improving equity. Parks are integral to urban well-being, offering spaces for recreation, social connection, and ecological preservation. With Calgary's ongoing urbanization, ensuring equitable access to parks is critical for enhancing quality of life and fostering sustainable growth. This analysis highlights park access challenges and opportunities in three communities, Abbeydale, Edgemont, and the Beltline, each with distinct geographic, infrastructural, and social contexts. However, the available data lends itself to the analysis of all Calgary communities.
